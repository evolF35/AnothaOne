function createPool(address oracle, int256 price, 
    uint256 settlementDate,uint256 decay,
    uint256 minRatio,uint256 minRatioDate,
    string memory name,string memory acronym ) 


so we have an: 

oracle address
settlement price
settlement date

decay factor
min ratio factor
min ratio date factor 

name 
acronym 

----------------------------------------
I had to add decay in order to prevent last minute depositing getting too much rewards
ie depositing at the beginning gets you the most POS or NEG, wheras at the end you get less. 


in the future: make the decay factor be able to change. ie polynomial or dependent on other variables / oracles lol.
in the future: make a capital factor. Incentivize bigger deposits with more POS or NEG 

// we can make capital factor like the decay factor in that it is variable, / polynomial 
or even dependent on another oracle. 

so make a decay and capital factor be from other oracle sources. 
Which can be a volatility oracle or some weird function oracle.
